# Intro

The simulator is the new v2.4 logic core meant to be resilient to future design team introduced memory leaks and other bugs.

## Setup

### On Linux or Mac OS (because they're both Unix variants)

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open a terminal in this directory (`CedarLogic/Simulator`).
3. Run the following bash commands:

```bash
mkdir -p build

cd build/

cmake ../ # You're telling cmake to create the makefiles here for the source back a level

cd ../  # go back to that directory

code .  # to open vs code and edit the source code to your heart's delight.

cd build  # Go back into the build directory when you want to build it.

make  # Just execute the default make command to compile it.

./test_simulator  # run the test application
```

Note, I saw something in VS-Code about treating Cmake as a first-class build system and it looked like it wanted to do the cmake configure and build
steps itself. I haven't investigated further but that's to say the steps above aren't the only way to do it.

If that's breaking because things aren't installed on your system, you'll want the following however you need to get them:
- Clang and/or GCC (I prefer clang)
- CMake
- Make

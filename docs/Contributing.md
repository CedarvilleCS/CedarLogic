# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute code. It will be meritocratically evaluated. Students: 
it doesn't matter that you are a student, make things better, and we'll merge it in.

We are trying to follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) and release early and often.

The [pull request template](../.github/pull_request_template.md) should tell you most of what you need to know about what is required of changes.

Please do not go about adding features that haven't been discussed. Those have a low likely hood of being merged in. Bug fixes, refactorings, and
changes to improve it as a multi-platform application are more likely to be accepted as well as improvements to docs, added unit tests, and the like. 
The feature set is pretty mature, what isn't great is the stability.

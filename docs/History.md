# History

CedarLogic was developed by [Cedarville University](https://www.cedarville.edu/) professors for classroom instruction. It was released on [Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cedarlogic/) in 2006 where  it's enjoyed long-lived popularity, over 20,000 downloads in 2019 alone.

The latest version available on Source Forge was released in 2011/12 and has been the public face of CedarLogic. That [version](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cedarlogic/files/) is still by far the most stable version of CedarLogic. Internally, senior design teams took a couple shots at improving it with added features, unfortunately accompanied by added bugs. The code-base at present has their improvements but also the accompanying instabilities.

The chief objective of development at this point is to fix any known bugs and stabilize the product before considering further improvements.
